Welcome to OS BIG Editor's SVN. This SVN is exclusively dedicated to OS BIG Editor, which is a program that reads and edit .BIG and .MEG files.

- OS BIG Editor 0.5 is the latest stable release.
- OS BIG Editor 0.6 is a work in progress. In the last update, the version is still 0.583 SVN Beta and the zip file of the 0.54 there is totally and horribly outdated.

You can download the latest unstable version by simply downloading the OS BIG Editor 0.6/Output directory and using the program from there.

Note that this code has almost everything that the 0.584 Beta (32/64 Bits edition) released in 05/06/2020 has, except for the lack of 64 bits support and uses an older version of the PNG library (the 64 bits one uses a PNG library from the same author that comes bundled with newer Delphi versions).
